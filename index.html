    <h3>Understanding the Impact on Your Career</h3>

    <p>
      Every year, over 542,000 robotic systems are installed globally. Robotic installations have more than doubled in the past decade, with installations expected to reach over 700,000 annually by 2028. Automation is going to affect your future career, no matter what industry you are looking to work in. Stores are a great example of how automation is impacting the workforce. Self serve registers have been appearing more and more in stores and have slowly been replacing human cashiers due to their accessibility, speed, and convenience when compared to human workers. Automated systems allow companies to become more efficient, productive, and more profitable. Due to these changes, many people have come to believe that automation is going to fully replace human workers. Rather than automation being the end of human workers, it has the potential to help complement human workers and create safer and more productive work environments.

      <h4>When Robots Create Jobs</h4>

      <p>
        In Europe robotic systems increased by over 4 times with robotic systems growing from only 100,000 units to over 400,000 units between 1995 and 2015. Although it seems like that would've lowered employment, it actually helped it grow by over <strong>1.3%</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Automated systems are meant to replace repetitive <em>tasks</em>, not entire <em>jobs</em>. For example, if a manufacturing plant has a fully automated assembly line the company would still need humans to program those systems, perform routine maintenance on them, ensure quality control for products, and be able to fix/respond to issues when something goes wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Europe, workers and companies invested in training workers to learn how to work with automated systems rather than trying to rapidly implement and replace human workers with these systems. Workers that got trained and learned how to work with these new technologies became more valuable and productive employees while workers that didn't have access to training and were more vulnerable to being displaced by automation.

  <!-- ROBOTIC AUTOMATION SECTION -->

  <section id="roboticAutomation" class="section">

    <h2>Robotic Automation</h2>

    <p class="hook">
      There are approximately 4.66 million industrial robots currently operating worldwide. A new robot is installed every 58 seconds, and by 2028, that is expected to increase to one every 45 seconds.
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h4 class="robot-definition-title">What are Robots?</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Robotic Process Automation</strong>, or <strong>RPA</strong>, refers to systems that are designed to carry out tasks automatically by following pre-programmed instructions. These systems are often paired with sensors and software to help them work with or around their environments, making them <strong>Intelligent Process Automation</strong>, or <strong>IPA</strong> systems. These robots typically handle jobs that involve something known as <strong>the three Ds</strong>, tasks that are either <strong>dull, dirty, or dangerous</strong> so that humans don't need to. RPA and IPA systems are helping revolutionize all kinds of industries by helping automate repetitive tasks or by working in unsafe conditions that would otherwise put humans at risk. This allows employees to focus on more complex and creative roles.
    </p>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
        <p>
          Robotic systems are redefining the manufacturing industry by helping to do dangerous or repetitive tasks for humans. These systems are able to perform tasks like welding for hours without fatigue, they can work in extreme heat, and lift massive parts that could easily injure human workers. The automotive industry has the highest number of robotic installations with an average of 7.5 robots per 1,000 workers which helps keep workers safer by keeping them out of dangerous positions and allowing employees to shift to different jobs like quality control, robotic technicians, or even programmers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>Warehouses</h4>
        <p>
          Warehouses are another industry that is being transformed by robotic automation. Employees in large warehouses used to have to walk over 15 miles a day while carrying and organizing large heavy packages which led to higher rates of injury and physical strain in employees. Recently, robotic systems like Amazon's Kiva, or Walmart’s R5, are able to move entire shelves of products directly to workers at workstations eliminating the strenuous labor workers used to have to endure. The introduction of these systems has shown a drop in severe injuries by 40% demonstrating how the implementation of automated systems is able to help keep employees safe.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>Agriculture</h4>
        <p>
          Agricultural industries are also benefiting from robotic systems. There are companies like Robovision that are creating robots with 3D vision and sensors to allow them to identify where they need to plant crops and when they need to be harvested. These robots can move with up to millimeter precision allowing them to plant, harvest, and navigate through fields with precision to prevent damaging crops. These systems are able to free farmers to focus on quality control, crop planning, and management rather than spending days on manually planting and harvesting crops.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>The Three Ds</h4>
        <p>
          Robots are most effective in environments that are dull, dirty, or dangerous where humans would struggle to work. Robots are able to perform tasks like cleaning up toxic waste, defusing bombs, exploring collapsed buildings, and working around toxic gases. In industrial settings, robots are used to work in ovens or other areas with intense temperatures to help manufacture and work with large and heavy metal objects quicker and safer than humans could. These systems are ensuring the safety of human employees by doing jobs that previously could give workers cancer, or life threatening injuries.

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence Automation</h2>

    <p class="hook">
      AI saves the average worker an hour every single day. That adds up to around 260 hours a year, over 6 full work weeks freed up with the assistance of AI.
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h4 class="ai-definition-title">What is AI?</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, or <strong>AI</strong>, refers to computer systems that analyze large sets of data to be able to recognize patterns and make decisions. Unlike RPA systems, AI systems can't physically interact with their environment. These systems instead just processes information that is given to it and generates an output based on the data it’s been trained on. These systems are able to help industries by performing large scale data analysis, assisting with medical diagnoses, and making marketing predictions for companies. <strong>Large Language Models</strong>, or <strong>LLMs</strong>, are the most widespread form of AI system and are able to process text information allowing them to be able to respond to human prompts. However, AI systems cannot improve on their own, instead they require constant high quality human generated data and human oversight to function properly.
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h3>Fields AI is changing</h3>

    <div class="ai-stat-grid">
      <div class="ai-stat-card">
        <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          AI systems excel at large scale data analysis. These systems are able to analyze thousands of transactions, accounts, and data trends in just minutes. Previously these tasks could’ve taken humans days, or even weeks to complete manually and was error prone work to begin with. AI systems are also helping by being able to optimize the production schedules for manufacturing companies, help businesses change prices, and be able to predict weather patterns. These systems are only able to recognize and analyze patterns, they are often incorrect and aren’t able to do anything with the predictions they make leaving human operators to need to be able to understand the information the AI gives them and be able to use it to make meaningful decisions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ai-stat-card">
        <h4>Healthcare</h4>
        <p>
          AI systems are transforming the healthcare industry by being able to analyze medical scans like X-rays, MRIs, and mammograms to detect patterns and abnormalities that might be overlooked by the human eye. These systems are able to notice microscopic details in scans by comparing it to thousands of previous cases to try to identify early stages of tumors, fractures, or tissue irregularities in a matter of minutes. These systems have been able to detect certain types of cancers up to a year earlier than traditional methods by spotting pixel level changes in scans that humans weren’t able to detect giving patients more time for treatment and increasing their chances for recovery. These systems are also being used to automate paperwork for medical professionals. Doctors currently spend nearly two hours on documentation for every hour with patients, now with the help of AI systems doctors are able to spend more time with patients, answering questions, and providing personalized care.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ai-stat-card">
        <h4>Job Interviews</h4>
        <p>
          AI systems have recently been implemented in the hiring process by performing job application screening and conducting initial interviews. These systems can review thousands of resumes in minutes, identifying candidates with specific qualifications and experience, something that would’ve taken human workers weeks to process manually. AI interview systems are also able to ask standardized questions and evaluate responses for keywords and communication patterns, helping companies filter candidates more efficiently. However, AI systems can only identify patterns and aren’t able to recognize potential that doesn't match traditional credentials. These systems have shown bias in the past with some systems even eliminating female candidates due to poor training data. Human recruiters are still needed to make final assessments on candidates and use these systems as assistants rather than final decision makers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ai-stat-card">
        <h4>Customer Service</h4>
        <p>
          LLMs have been deployed in customer service increasingly over the past couple years to be able to handle customers' questions quickly and efficiently. These systems respond to common questions like resetting passwords, site navigation, or other basic information that previously took away from human workers’ time when they could be answering more important or complicated questions. These systems are able to operate 24/7 ensuring that customers get an immediate response regardless of when they ask, removing the delay that human customer support services have. However, these systems can only respond to predictable questions and struggle with complex ones. These systems aren’t able to fully understand the context of conversations, emotional cues, and lack empathy and problem solving skills that human workers have. Human customer service representatives are still needed to handle more complex tasks and questions while AI systems will be able to answer redundant and simple questions that customers may have.
