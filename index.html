    <h3>Understanding the Impact on Your Career</h3>

    <p>
      Over 542,000 robotic systems are installed annually around the world, which is more than double what it was just 10 years ago. Whether you're planning to become a doctor, mechanic, retail worker, or even a police officer, automation will impact and change the way you do your job. Look at grocery stores for example, cash registers have essentially been fully replaced with self checkouts due to their speed and convenience when compared to human cashiers for customers. Companies have been installing hundreds of millions of automated systems to help cut costs and increase productivity reshaping the job market as we know it. This has made a lot of people believe that this could be the end of human workers, but I believe that automation will be a valuable tool to help human workers rather than fully replace them. This website explores both the drawbacks and benefits of automated systems, and how workers can adapt to these systems rather than be replaced by them.

      <h4>When Robots Create Jobs</h4>

      <p>
        In Europe robotic systems increased by over 4 times with robotic systems growing from only 100,000 units to over 400,000 units between the years of 1995 and 2015. Although it seems like that would've lowered employment, it actually helped it grow by over <strong>1.3%</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Automated systems are meant to replace repetitive <em>tasks</em>, not entire <em>jobs</em>. For example, if a manufacturing plant has a fully automated assembly line and manufacturing plant the company would still need humans to program those systems, perform maintenance exams on them, ensure quality control for products, and be able to fix/respond to issues when something goes wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Europe, workers and companies invested in training workers to learn how to work with automated systems rather than trying to rapidly implement and replace human workers with these systems. Workers that got trained and learned how to work with these new technologies became more valuable and productive employees while workers that didn't have access to training ended up getting replaced by these systems.

  <!-- ROBOTIC AUTOMATION SECTION -->

  <section id="roboticAutomation" class="section">

    <h2>Robotic Automation</h2>

    <p class="hook">
      There are approximately 4.66 million industrial robots currently operating worldwide. A new robot is installed every 58 seconds, and by 2028, that is expected to increase to one every 45 seconds.
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h4 class="robot-definition-title">What are Robots?</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Robotic Process Automation</strong>, or <strong>RPA</strong>, are systems that are designed to carry out tasks automatically by following pre-programmed instructions. These systems are often paired with sensors and software to help them work with or around their environments making them <strong>Intelligent Process Automation</strong>, or <strong>IPA</strong> systems. These robots typically will perform tasks known as <strong>the three Ds</strong> which are tasks that are either <strong>dull, dirty, or dangerous</strong> so that humans don't need to. RPA and IPA systems are helping revolutionize all kinds of industries by helping automate repetitive tasks or by by working in unsafe conditions that would otherwise put humans at risk. This allows employees to focus on more complex and creative roles.
    </p>

        <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
        <p>
          Robotics is helping redefine the manufacturing industry by helping to do dangerous or repetitive tasks for humans. Robotics systems are able to perform tasks like welding for hours without fatigue, they can work in extreme heat, and lift massive parts that could easily injure human workers. The automotive industry has the highest amount of robotic installations with there being 7.5 robots per 1,000 workers which helps keep workers safer by keeping them out of dangerous positions and allowing employees to shift to different jobs like quality control, system mechanics, or even robotic programmers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>Warehouses</h4>
        <p>
          Warehouses are another industry being transformed by robotic systems. Robots like Amazon's Kiva unit are able to move entire shelves full of products to workers at speeds of 3 miles an hour helping save employees from lifting heavy packages and walking 15+ miles a day. Employees now can stand at work stations and have robots deliver packages to them to distribute to wherever they need to go. These systems are able to run 24/7 so packages can be sorted constantly to help keep things organized for when they need to be distributed and moved out faster than previously possible.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>Agriculture</h4>
        <p>
          Agricultural industries are also benefiting from robotic systems. There are companies like Robovision that are creating robots with 3D vision and sensors on them to allow them to identify where they need to plant crops and when they need to be harvested. These robots can move with up to millimeter precision allowing them to carefully plant and harvest crops and carefully navigate through fields without damaging crops. These systems allow farmers to focus on quality control and planning what crops to grow and other management jobs rather than needing to spend multiple days harvesting crops and planting them during busy seasons.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>The Three Ds</h4>
        <p>
          Robots are most effective in environments that are dull, dirty, or dangerous where humans would struggle to work in. Robots are able to perform tasks like cleaning up toxic waste, defusing bombs, exploring collapsed buildings, and working around toxic gasses. In industrial settings robots are used to work in ovens or other areas with intense temperatures to help manufacture and work with large and heavy metal objects quicker and safer than humans would be able to. These systems are ensuring the safety of human employees by doing jobs that previously could give workers cancer, chronic injuries, or introducing them to life threatening situations.

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="outlook-context">
        Although there are job losses and real downsides to robotic automation, there are also positive spillover benefits to industries as a whole. Industries have been made safer and more efficient, allowing humans to move away from dangerous, repetitive labor and into roles that require creativity, problem-solving, and oversight.

    <h4 class="ai-definition-title">What is AI?</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>AI</strong>, or <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, are systems that analyze large sets of data to recognize patterns and make decisions based on previous knowledge. Unlike robotic systems which physically interact with their environment, AI systems operate invisibly and process information letting it make predictions, assist with tasks like data analysis, medical diagnosis, and even hiring decisions. Modern AI systems come in different forms with the most commonly used ones being <strong>Large Language Models</strong>, otherwise known as <strong>LLMs</strong>. LLMs are systems that are trained on massive amounts of text which allows them to understand context of words and information they are given and make sentences that make sense. However, AI systems cannot learn or improve on their own indefinitely, these systems require constant high quality human generated data and oversight to function properly, making human input essential to their operation.

    <div class="ai-stat-grid">
      <div class="ai-stat-card">
        <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          AI systems excel at large scale data analysis. These systems are able to analyze thousands of transactions, interactions, and data trends in just minutes. A task that previously would’ve taken humans days, or even weeks to complete manually. AI systems are also helping by optimizing production schedules for manufacturing companies, assisting accounting professionals by finding discrepancies in financial data, and helping forecast market trends by looking at historical market data. However, AI systems can only recognize and analyze patterns, they cannot interpret the meaning of those patterns and how they impact business strategies, understand the moods of clients and their needs, or make judgment calls about which trends matter and which ones do not.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ai-stat-card">
        <h4>Healthcare</h4>
        <p>
          AI systems are transforming healthcare by helping analyze medical scans like X-rays, MRIs, and mammograms to detect patterns and abnormalities that might be overlooked by the human eye. These systems are able to notice microscopic details in scans by comparing it to thousands of previous cases to try to identify early stages of tumors, fractures, or tissue irregularities. AI diagnostic tools are sometimes able to detect certain types of cancers up to a year earlier than traditional methods by spotting pixel level changes in scans giving patients extra time for treatment and higher chances for recovery. These systems are also helping by automating paperwork for medical professionals. Doctors currently spend nearly two hours on documentation for every hour with patients, now with these AI systems doctors can spend time with patients answering questions and providing personalized care.
