  <h3>83 million jobs lost to automation. 69 million new jobs created. Someone's getting left behind - and it won't be the people who prepared.</h3>
  <!--Intro subject to change-->
  <p class="home1">Over 542,000 robots are installed in globally every year, double what it was just a decade ago. 83 million jobs are predicted to be replaced by automation while only 69 million jobs will be created by it. That leaves 14 million people without work. But automation doesn't have to be a threat. It's a tool that will either replace you or empower you - and the difference comes down to understanding how it works and where you fit in.</p>
