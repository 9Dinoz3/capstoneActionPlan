  <h3>83 million jobs lost to automation. 69 million new jobs created. Someone's getting left behind - and it won't be the people who prepared.</h3>
  <!--Intro subject to change-->
  <p class="home1">Over 542,000 robots are installed globally every year, double what it was just a decade ago. 83 million jobs are predicted to be replaced by automation while only 69 million jobs will be created by it. That leaves 14 million people without work. But automation doesn't have to be a threat. It's a tool that will either replace you or empower you - and the difference comes down to understanding how it works and where you fit in.</p>
  
  <h3>Why This Matters to You</h3>
  <p class="home2">Whether you're planning to be a nurse, mechanic, graphic designer, or work retail, automation will change how you do your job. Even part-time work like cashier positions and warehouse jobs are being transformed right now. This isn't some distant future, companies are installing over half a million robots every single year. The workplace you enter after graduation will look nothing like the one your parents knew.</p>
