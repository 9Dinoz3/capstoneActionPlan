    <h3>Understanding the Impact on Your Career</h3>

    <p>
      Every year, over 542,000 robotic systems are installed globally. Robotic installations have more than doubled in the past decade, with installations expected to reach over 700,000 annually by 2028. Automation is going to affect your future career, no matter what industry you are looking to work in. Stores are a great example of how automation is impacting the workforce. Self serve registers have been appearing more and more in stores and have slowly been replacing human cashiers due to their accessibility, speed, and convenience when compared to human workers. Automated systems allow companies to become more efficient, productive, and more profitable. Due to these changes, many people have come to believe that automation is going to fully replace human workers. Rather than automation being the end of human workers, it has the potential to help complement human workers and create safer and more productive work environments.

      <h4>When Robots Create Jobs</h4>

      <p>
        In Europe robotic systems increased by over 4 times with robotic systems growing from only 100,000 units to over 400,000 units between 1995 and 2015. Although it seems like that would've lowered employment, it actually helped it grow by over <strong>1.3%</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Automated systems are meant to replace repetitive <em>tasks</em>, not entire <em>jobs</em>. For example, if a manufacturing plant has a fully automated assembly line the company would still need humans to program those systems, perform routine maintenance on them, ensure quality control for products, and be able to fix/respond to issues when something goes wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Europe, workers and companies invested in training workers to learn how to work with automated systems rather than trying to rapidly implement and replace human workers with these systems. Workers that got trained and learned how to work with these new technologies became more valuable and productive employees while workers that didn't have access to training and were more vulnerable to being displaced by automation.

  <!-- ROBOTIC AUTOMATION SECTION -->

  <section id="roboticAutomation" class="section">

    <h2>Robotic Automation</h2>

    <p class="hook">
      There are approximately 4.66 million industrial robots currently operating worldwide. A new robot is installed every 58 seconds, and by 2028, that is expected to increase to one every 45 seconds.
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h4 class="robot-definition-title">What are Robots?</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Robotic Process Automation</strong>, or <strong>RPA</strong>, refers to systems that are designed to carry out tasks automatically by following pre-programmed instructions. These systems are often paired with sensors and software to help them work with or around their environments, making them <strong>Intelligent Process Automation</strong>, or <strong>IPA</strong> systems. These robots typically handle jobs that involve something known as <strong>the three Ds</strong>, tasks that are either <strong>dull, dirty, or dangerous</strong> so that humans don't need to. RPA and IPA systems are helping revolutionize all kinds of industries by helping automate repetitive tasks or by working in unsafe conditions that would otherwise put humans at risk. This allows employees to focus on more complex and creative roles.
    </p>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
        <p>
          Robotic systems are redefining the manufacturing industry by helping to do dangerous or repetitive tasks for humans. These systems are able to perform tasks like welding for hours without fatigue, they can work in extreme heat, and lift massive parts that could easily injure human workers. The automotive industry has the highest number of robotic installations with an average of 7.5 robots per 1,000 workers which helps keep workers safer by keeping them out of dangerous positions and allowing employees to shift to different jobs like quality control, robotic technicians, or even programmers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>Warehouses</h4>
        <p>
          Warehouses are another industry that is being transformed by robotic automation. Employees in large warehouses used to have to walk over 15 miles a day while carrying and organizing large heavy packages which led to higher rates of injury and physical strain in employees. Recently, robotic systems like Amazon's Kiva, or Walmart’s R5, are able to move entire shelves of products directly to workers at workstations eliminating the strenuous labor workers used to have to endure. The introduction of these systems has shown a drop in severe injuries by 40% demonstrating how the implementation of automated systems is able to help keep employees safe.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>Agriculture</h4>
        <p>
          Agricultural industries are also benefiting from robotic systems. There are companies like Robovision that are creating robots with 3D vision and sensors to allow them to identify where they need to plant crops and when they need to be harvested. These robots can move with up to millimeter precision allowing them to plant, harvest, and navigate through fields with precision to prevent damaging crops. These systems are able to free farmers to focus on quality control, crop planning, and management rather than spending days on manually planting and harvesting crops.

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>The Three Ds</h4>
        <p>
          Robots are most effective in environments that are dull, dirty, or dangerous where humans would struggle to work. Robots are able to perform tasks like cleaning up toxic waste, defusing bombs, exploring collapsed buildings, and working around toxic gases. In industrial settings, robots are used to work in ovens or other areas with intense temperatures to help manufacture and work with large and heavy metal objects quicker and safer than humans could. These systems are ensuring the safety of human employees by doing jobs that previously could give workers cancer, or life threatening injuries.

    <h4 class="ai-definition-title">What is AI?</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, or <strong>AI</strong>, refers to computer systems that analyze large sets of data to be able to recognize patterns and make decisions. Unlike RPA systems, AI systems can't physically interact with their environment. These systems instead just processes information that is given to it and generates an output based on the data it’s been trained on. These systems are able to help industries by performing large scale data analysis, assisting with medical diagnoses, and making marketing predictions for companies. <strong>Large Language Models</strong>, or <strong>LLMs</strong>, are the most widespread form of AI system and are able to process text information allowing them to be able to respond to human prompts. However, AI systems cannot improve on their own, instead they require constant high quality human generated data and human oversight to function properly.
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <div class="ai-stat-grid">
      <div class="ai-stat-card">
        <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          AI systems excel at large scale data analysis. These systems are able to analyze thousands of transactions, accounts, and data trends in just minutes. Previously these tasks could’ve taken humans days, or even weeks to complete manually and was error prone work to begin with. AI systems are also helping by being able to optimize the production schedules for manufacturing companies, help businesses change prices, and be able to predict weather patterns. These systems are only able to recognize and analyze patterns, they are often incorrect and aren’t able to do anything with the predictions they make leaving human operators to need to be able to understand the information the AI gives them and be able to use it to make meaningful decisions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ai-stat-card">
        <h4>Healthcare</h4>
        <p>
          AI systems are transforming the healthcare industry by being able to analyze medical scans like X-rays, MRIs, and mammograms to detect patterns and abnormalities that might be overlooked by the human eye. These systems are able to notice microscopic details in scans by comparing it to thousands of previous cases to try to identify early stages of tumors, fractures, or tissue irregularities in a matter of minutes. These systems have been able to detect certain types of cancers up to a year earlier than traditional methods by spotting pixel level changes in scans that humans weren’t able to detect giving patients more time for treatment and increasing their chances for recovery. These systems are also being used to automate paperwork for medical professionals. Doctors currently spend nearly two hours on documentation for every hour with patients, now with the help of AI systems doctors are able to spend more time with patients, answering questions, and providing personalized care.

        <h4>Job Interviews</h4>
        <p>
          AI systems have recently been implemented in the hiring process by performing job application screening and conducting initial interviews. These systems can review thousands of resumes in minutes, identifying candidates with specific qualifications and experience, something that would’ve taken human workers weeks to process manually. AI interview systems are also able to ask standardized questions and evaluate responses for keywords and communication patterns, helping companies filter candidates more efficiently. However, AI systems can only identify patterns and aren’t able to recognize potential that doesn't match traditional credentials. These systems have shown bias in the past with some systems even eliminating female candidates due to poor training data. Human recruiters are still needed to make final assessments on candidates and use these systems as assistants rather than final decision makers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ai-stat-card">
        <h4>Customer Service</h4>
        <p>
          LLMs have been deployed in customer service increasingly over the past couple years to be able to handle customers' questions quickly and efficiently. These systems respond to common questions like resetting passwords, site navigation, or other basic information that previously took away from human workers’ time when they could be answering more important or complicated questions. These systems are able to operate 24/7 ensuring that customers get an immediate response regardless of when they ask, removing the delay that human customer support services have. However, these systems can only respond to predictable questions and struggle with complex ones. These systems aren’t able to fully understand the context of conversations, emotional cues, and lack empathy and problem solving skills that human workers have. Human customer service representatives are still needed to handle more complex tasks and questions while AI systems will be able to answer redundant and simple questions that customers may have.

    <h3>What skills are needed for the future?</h3>

    <p>RPA and AI systems are being implemented in industries not to fully replace human workers, but instead to assist them by <strong>automating repetitive, strenuous, and error-prone tasks</strong>. Human employees now need to focus on developing <strong>human-specific skills like empathy, creative thinking, and problem-solving</strong> which automated systems don't have. Workers like data analysts can use AI systems to analyze thousands of transactions in a matter of minutes to determine what trends are important to focus on and which ones aren't. Manufacturing workers use RPA systems to automate repetitive tasks and keep employees safe, allowing employees to focus on making judgment calls when issues occur and designing new products.</p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h3>What skills should you learn to prepare?</h3>

    <div class="prepare-grid">
      <div class="prepare-card">
        <h4>Human Skills</h4>
        <p>
          Skills that are uniquely human are going to be the most valuable skills you can learn while preparing to enter the workforce. Skills like empathy, creativity, problem solving, and effective communication are becoming more important as automated systems can't replace them the way they can with other tasks. AI systems are able to analyze medical scans in a matter of seconds, but they aren't able to help patients understand what these results mean or empathize with their fears and concerns they may have. RPA systems can perform precision tasks for hours without fatigue, but they need human operators to troubleshoot when something goes wrong, adjust production schedules based on demand, or redesign workflows to improve efficiency. What makes these skills so valuable is that they require a good understanding of context, the ability to read people, and being able to make judgment calls in situations that don't follow predictable patterns, things automated systems can't do. Although these skills might seem natural, you can improve and further develop them right now. Most jobs available to high school students involve customer service, like retail and food service, which helps you build communication skills, make on the spot decisions, and de-escalate situations with frustrated customers. These jobs put you in unpredictable situations constantly, which teaches you how to think quickly, and be able to adapt when things go wrong. Another way you can improve your human skills is by working in team based environments like group projects or after school clubs. In these environments you build leadership skills by organizing people and ensuring tasks get completed, develop communication skills by discussing ideas and working through disagreements, and learn how to compromise when teammates have different opinions. Volunteer work is also a powerful way to develop empathy specifically. When volunteering you'll often be working with people from different backgrounds or in challenging situations, which helps you understand different perspectives and see how your actions can make a real impact on someone's life. These human specific skills are what will make you stand out in an automated workforce compared to other candidates.

        <h4>Technical Skills</h4>
        <p>
          You don’t need to be a software engineer or a robotics engineer to be able to be successful in a job market mainly run by automated systems, but you do need to understand how these automated systems work and how to effectively work with them. Between 1980 and 2018 bookkeepers and accounting clerks saw automation cut a third of their positions, but the workers that stayed and used automation as tools to help them learn new, more valuable skills helped their wages rise by over 40%. The automated systems handled the tasks like manually entering large amounts of data and inventory management allowing for workers to work on tasks like making financial decisions and expanding their human expertise and value. This same pattern has appeared across industries as automation has expanded. The technical skills needed for the future aren’t needing to be a master programmer or being able to create fully automated systems yourself, but just being able to understand how they work. If you know the basics of programming and how automated systems make decisions and function you can understand why these systems behave the way they do and are able to work on these systems if they end up malfunctioning. Another technical skill that will be needed is having good data literacy skills. Being able to work with spreadsheets, understand charts, and knowing basic statistics skills will be helpful for your future career regardless of what industry you pursue. Another important skill is knowing when automated systems are wrong. Automated systems are made to sound human but they aren’t and oftentimes confuse words and mix up information creating hallucinations. These systems have extensive knowledge of language structure so when they believe something is correct they can phrase it in such a way to make you believe that it’s correct as well so it’s easy to not notice when these systems are giving false information. You can start learning how to build these skills now by using free programming platforms like Codecademy with beginner friendly and important languages like Python. Practicing with tools like Excel or Google Sheets is also important to learn how to work with large datasets and navigate common spreadsheet tools that companies use. Workers that are technically literate are exactly what the future job market is looking for.

      <h4>Automation Expanding Industry</h4>

      <p>
        Automation has been shown to create new opportunities and help expand industries in the past. In the 1970s when ATMs were first being introduced people assumed that bank tellers would be fully replaced by these systems due to them being able to run 24/7 and operate more efficiently than human tellers could. However, these systems actually helped reduce the costs of operating banks allowing for banking companies to open more locations which expanded the industry and increased demand for bank tellers. Employment for bank tellers kept expanding after the introduction of ATMs because ATMs automated the tasks that bank tellers didn’t want to do. Bank tellers were able to focus on customer service and giving financial advice rather than counting and handling money, making their job less stressful and more engaging.
      </p>

      <p>
        This trend is still continuing today as automation replaces manufacturing jobs. Between November 2024 and January 2025 the automotive manufacturing industry lost around 16,000 jobs due to automation. During the same time period industries like healthcare, retail, and social services grew by approximately 100,000 jobs, a net gain of 84,000 workers. Healthcare is an industry that recently has been expanding due to an aging population and the demand for medical services, creating an increased demand for workers with human and technical skills. These trends show that while automation is replacing jobs in certain industries, it’s allowing workers to shift to more skilled, higher-paying careers.

        <h4>Machine Learning Engineer</h4>
        <p>
          Due to the rapid expansion of AI systems and the rapid growth the field is having, machine learning engineers have become increasingly valuable to be able to train and create new AI systems and help make new discoveries in this new field. AI systems aren’t able to improve on their own without human input, or else they’d fall into something called model collapse, a scenario where an AI system trains on AI-generated data and ends up degrading itself to an extent where it can’t even perform basic tasks anymore. Machine learning engineers are tasked with finding high quality and unbiased training data to train and improve models and prevent issues like agentic misalignment. The education required to become a machine learning engineer is a bachelor’s degree in a related field like computer science or AI engineering with a master’s degree being optional but preferred. The current average salary for a machine learning engineer is $186,000 annually, making it one of the highest paying and fastest growing careers in the current job market.

        <h4>Financial Analyst</h4>
        <p>
          Financial analysts are a great example of a non-technical career that has started to grow because of automation. As automated systems take over repetitive tasks, the remaining tasks required for these positions become more important, leading to an increase in demand and salary for these positions. Financial analysts study market trends, evaluate investment opportunities, and help companies make strategic financial decisions. AI systems are able to help assist financial analysts but aren’t actually able to come up with these decisions themselves, making skilled workers important to this field. The educational requirements to become a financial analyst are typically a bachelor’s degree in finance, economics, or a related field, with certain companies preferring CFA certifications for more advanced positions. The average salary for a financial analyst is currently around $82,000 annually and as AI systems continue to handle more routine financial tasks, the demand for skilled analysts who can interpret and act on that data will only increase.
