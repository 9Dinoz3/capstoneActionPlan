<p class="stat-conclusion">That's 14 million workers replaced. But here's the twist: European workers saw employment <span class="highlight-green">increase by 1.3%</span> when robots arrived. The difference? They learned to work WITH automation instead of against it.</p>
  
  <h3>Why This Matters to You</h3>
  <p class="home2">Whether you're planning to be a nurse, mechanic, graphic designer, or work retail, automation will change how you do your job. Even part-time work like cashier positions and warehouse jobs are being transformed right now. This isn't some distant future, companies are installing over half a million robots every single year. The workplace you enter after graduation will look nothing like the one your parents knew.</p>
