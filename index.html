    <h3>Understanding the Impact on Your Career</h3>

    <p>
      Every year, over 542,000 robotic systems are installed globally. Robotic installations have more than doubled in the past decade, with installations expected to reach over 700,000 annually by 2028. Automation is going to affect your future career, no matter what industry you are looking to work in. Stores are a great example of how automation is impacting the workforce. Self serve registers have been appearing more and more in stores and have slowly been replacing human cashiers due to their accessibility, speed, and convenience when compared to human workers. Automated systems allow companies to become more efficient, productive, and more profitable. Due to these changes, many people have come to believe that automation is going to fully replace human workers. Rather than automation being the end of human workers, it has the potential to help complement human workers and create safer and more productive work environments.

      <h4>When Robots Create Jobs</h4>

      <p>
        In Europe robotic systems increased by over 4 times with robotic systems growing from only 100,000 units to over 400,000 units between 1995 and 2015. Although it seems like that would've lowered employment, it actually helped it grow by over <strong>1.3%</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Automated systems are meant to replace repetitive <em>tasks</em>, not entire <em>jobs</em>. For example, if a manufacturing plant has a fully automated assembly line the company would still need humans to program those systems, perform routine maintenance on them, ensure quality control for products, and be able to fix/respond to issues when something goes wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Europe, workers and companies invested in training workers to learn how to work with automated systems rather than trying to rapidly implement and replace human workers with these systems. Workers that got trained and learned how to work with these new technologies became more valuable and productive employees while workers that didn't have access to training and were more vulnerable to being displaced by automation.

  <!-- ROBOTIC AUTOMATION SECTION -->

  <section id="roboticAutomation" class="section">

    <h2>Robotic Automation</h2>

    <p class="hook">
      There are approximately 4.66 million industrial robots currently operating worldwide. A new robot is installed every 58 seconds, and by 2028, that is expected to increase to one every 45 seconds.
    </p>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h4 class="robot-definition-title">What are Robots?</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Robotic Process Automation</strong>, or <strong>RPA</strong>, refers to systems that are designed to carry out tasks automatically by following pre-programmed instructions. These systems are often paired with sensors and software to help them work with or around their environments, making them <strong>Intelligent Process Automation</strong>, or <strong>IPA</strong> systems. These robots typically handle jobs that involve something known as <strong>the three Ds</strong>, tasks that are either <strong>dull, dirty, or dangerous</strong> so that humans don't need to. RPA and IPA systems are helping revolutionize all kinds of industries by helping automate repetitive tasks or by working in unsafe conditions that would otherwise put humans at risk. This allows employees to focus on more complex and creative roles.
    </p>

        <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
        <p>
          Robotic systems are redefining the manufacturing industry by helping to do dangerous or repetitive tasks for humans. These systems are able to perform tasks like welding for hours without fatigue, they can work in extreme heat, and lift massive parts that could easily injure human workers. The automotive industry has the highest number of robotic installations with an average of 7.5 robots per 1,000 workers which helps keep workers safer by keeping them out of dangerous positions and allowing employees to shift to different jobs like quality control, robotic technicians, or even programmers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>Warehouses</h4>
        <p>
          Warehouses are another industry that is being transformed by robotic automation. Employees in large warehouses used to have to walk over 15 miles a day while carrying and organizing large heavy packages which led to higher rates of injury and physical strain in employees. Recently, robotic systems like Amazon's Kiva, or Walmart’s R5, are able to move entire shelves of products directly to workers at workstations eliminating the strenuous labor workers used to have to endure. The introduction of these systems has shown a drop in severe injuries by 40% demonstrating how the implementation of automated systems is able to help keep employees safe.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>Agriculture</h4>
        <p>
          Agricultural industries are also benefiting from robotic systems. There are companies like Robovision that are creating robots with 3D vision and sensors to allow them to identify where they need to plant crops and when they need to be harvested. These robots can move with up to millimeter precision allowing them to plant, harvest, and navigate through fields with precision to prevent damaging crops. These systems are able to free farmers to focus on quality control, crop planning, and management rather than spending days on manually planting and harvesting crops.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="robot-stat-card">
        <h4>The Three Ds</h4>
        <p>
          Robots are most effective in environments that are dull, dirty, or dangerous where humans would struggle to work. Robots are able to perform tasks like cleaning up toxic waste, defusing bombs, exploring collapsed buildings, and working around toxic gases. In industrial settings, robots are used to work in ovens or other areas with intense temperatures to help manufacture and work with large and heavy metal objects quicker and safer than humans could. These systems are ensuring the safety of human employees by doing jobs that previously could give workers cancer, or life threatening injuries.

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="outlook-context">
        Although there are job losses and real downsides to robotic automation, there are also positive spillover benefits to industries as a whole. Industries have been made safer and more efficient, allowing humans to move away from dangerous, repetitive labor and into roles that require creativity, problem-solving, and oversight.

    <h4 class="ai-definition-title">What is AI?</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>AI</strong>, or <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, are systems that analyze large sets of data to recognize patterns and make decisions based on previous knowledge. Unlike robotic systems which physically interact with their environment, AI systems operate invisibly and process information letting it make predictions, assist with tasks like data analysis, medical diagnosis, and even hiring decisions. Modern AI systems come in different forms with the most commonly used ones being <strong>Large Language Models</strong>, otherwise known as <strong>LLMs</strong>. LLMs are systems that are trained on massive amounts of text which allows them to understand context of words and information they are given and make sentences that make sense. However, AI systems cannot learn or improve on their own indefinitely, these systems require constant high quality human generated data and oversight to function properly, making human input essential to their operation.

        <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          AI systems excel at large scale data analysis. These systems are able to analyze thousands of transactions, interactions, and data trends in just minutes. A task that previously would’ve taken humans days, or even weeks to complete manually. AI systems are also helping by optimizing production schedules for manufacturing companies, assisting accounting professionals by finding discrepancies in financial data, and helping forecast market trends by looking at historical market data. However, AI systems can only recognize and analyze patterns, they cannot interpret the meaning of those patterns and how they impact business strategies, understand the moods of clients and their needs, or make judgment calls about which trends matter and which ones do not.

      <div class="ai-stat-card">
        <h4>Healthcare</h4>
        <p>
          AI systems are transforming healthcare by helping analyze medical scans like X-rays, MRIs, and mammograms to detect patterns and abnormalities that might be overlooked by the human eye. These systems are able to notice microscopic details in scans by comparing it to thousands of previous cases to try to identify early stages of tumors, fractures, or tissue irregularities. AI diagnostic tools are sometimes able to detect certain types of cancers up to a year earlier than traditional methods by spotting pixel level changes in scans giving patients extra time for treatment and higher chances for recovery. These systems are also helping by automating paperwork for medical professionals. Doctors currently spend nearly two hours on documentation for every hour with patients, now with these AI systems doctors can spend time with patients answering questions and providing personalized care.
