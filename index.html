    <h3>Why This Matters to You</h3>
    
    <p>
      Over 542,000 robots are installed globally every year, that's double what it was just a decade ago. Whether you're planning to be a nurse, mechanic, graphic designer, or a retail worker, automation will change how you do your job. Even part-time work like cashier positions and warehouse jobs are being transformed right now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think about your first job. Maybe it was at a fast-food restaurant where kiosks are already replacing cashiers. Or think about a warehouse where robots move products while humans just monitor screens. Or a hospital where AI reads X-rays faster than radiologists. <strong>This isn't some distant future, it's happening now.</strong> Companies are installing over half a million robots every single year. The workplace you enter after graduation will look nothing like the one your parents knew.
    </p>

    <p>
      But here's what most people miss: automation doesn't just destroy jobs. It transforms them. The question isn't whether automation will affect your career, it's whether you'll be the one replaced by it, or the one managing it.

      <h4>The European Exception: When Robots Created Jobs</h4>
      
      <p>
        When robots increased 4x in Europe between 1995-2015 (from 100,000 to 400,000 units), something unexpected happened. Employment didn't crash, it <strong>grew by 1.3%</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why? Because robots replaced repetitive <em>tasks</em>, not entire <em>jobs</em>. A car factory that automated welding still needed humans to program the robots, maintain them, handle quality control, and make judgment calls when things went wrong. Workers who adapted moved into higher skilled roles, often with better pay and safer working conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The difference?</strong> European workers and companies invested in training. They didn't fight automation, they learned to work alongside it. The workers who lost their jobs were the ones who refused to adapt. The ones who thrived were those who saw the robots as tools, not replacements.
